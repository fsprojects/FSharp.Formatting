"===============================\n",
"\n",
"A nice feature of the literate programming package (`FSharp.Formatting.Literate.dll` in F# Formatting)\n",
"is that it lets you embed the result of running the script as part of the literate output.\n",
"This is a feature of the functions discussed in [literate programming](literate.html) and\n",
"it is implemented using the [F# Compiler service](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/).\n",
"\n",
"Embedding literate script output\n",
"--------------------------------\n",
"\n",
"The functionality is currently available (and tested) for F# script files (`*.fsx`) that\n",
"contain special comments to embed the Markdown text. To embed output of a script file, \n",
"a couple of additional special comments are added.\n",
"\n",
"The following snippet (F# Script file) demonstates the functionality:\n",
"\n",
"    let test = 40 + 2\n",
"\n",
"    printf \"A result is: %d\" test\n",
"    (*** include-output ***)\n",
"\n",
"You can also use `(*** include-fsi-output ***)` to include the F# interactive output instead,\n",
"such as type signatures.\n",
"\n",
"    let test = 40 + 3\n",
"\n",
"    (*** include-fsi-output ***)\n",
"\n",
"To include both console otuput and F# Interactive output use `(*** include-fsi-merged-output ***)`.\n",
"\n",
"    let test = 40 + 4\n",
"\n",
"    (*** include-fsi-merged-output ***)\n",
"\n",
"The script defines a variable `test` and then prints it. The console output is included\n",
"in the output.\n",
"\n",
"In addition to the commands demonstrated in the above sample, you can also use\n",
"the following variations to include the output and `it` values produced by a named snippet.\n",
"\n",
"    (*** include-it: test ***)\n",
"    (*** include-fsi-output: test ***)\n",
"    (*** include-output: test ***)\n",
"\n",
"Specifying the evaluator and formatting \n",
"---------------------------------------\n",
"The embedding of F# output requires specifying an additional parameter to the \n",
"parsing functions discussed in [literate programming documentation](literate.html).\n",
"Assuming you have all the references in place, you can now create an instance of\n",
"`FsiEvaluator` that represents a wrapper for F# interactive and pass it to all the\n",
"functions that parse script files or process script files:\n",

"Emitting Raw Text\n",

"\n",
"Custom formatting functions\n",
"---------------------------\n",
"\n",
"As mentioned earlier, values are formatted using a simple `\"%A\"` formatter by default.\n",
"However, you can specify a formatting function that provides a nicer formatting for values\n",
"of certain types. For example, let\u0027s say that we would want to format F# lists such as\n",
"`[1; 2; 3]` as HTML ordered lists `\u003col\u003e`. \n",
"\n",
"This can be done by calling `RegisterTransformation` on the `FsiEvaluator` instance:\n",
