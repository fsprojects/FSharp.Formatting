"F# Formatting: Literate programming\n",
"===================================\n",
"\n",
"The [command-line tool `fsdocs`](commandline.html) or the `FSharp.Formatting.Literate` namespace implements \n",
"a literate programming model for F# script files (`*.fsx` files) or Markdown\n",
"documents (`*.md` files) containing F# snippets.\n",
"\n",
"Two inputs are accepted:\n",
"\n",
" - Documents that are valid F# script files (`*.fsx`) and contain special\n",
"   comments with documentation and commands for generating HTML output\n",
"\n",
" - Documents that are Markdown documents (`*.md`) and contain blocks of \n",
"   F# code (indented by four spaces as usual in Markdown)\n",
"\n",
"### F# Script files\n",
"\n",
"The following example shows most of the features that can be used in a literate\n",
"F# script file. Most of the features should be quite self-explanatory:\n",
"\n",
"    (**\n",
"    # First-level heading\n",
"    Some more documentation using `Markdown`.\n",
"    *)\n",
"    \n",
"    let helloWorld() = printfn \"Hello world!\"\n",
"\n",
"    (** \n",
"    ## Second-level heading\n",
"    With some more documentation\n",
"    *)\n",
"    \n",
"    let numbers = [ 0 .. 99 ]\n",
"    (*** include-value: numbers ***)\n",
"\n",
"    List.sum numbers\n",
"    (*** include-it ***)\n",
"\n",
"The F# script files is processed as follows:\n",
"\n",
"- A multi-line comment starting with `(**` and ending with `*)` is \n",
"  turned into text and is processed using the F# Markdown processor \n",
"  (which supports standard Markdown commands).\n",
"\n",
"- A single-line comment starting with `(***` and ending with `***)` \n",
"  is treated as a special command. The command can consist of \n",
"  `key`, `key: value` or `key=value` pairs.\n",
"\n",
"|  Literate Command     | Description               |\n",
"|:-----------------------|:----------------------------|\n",
"|   `(** ... *)`       | Markdown  |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: prepare ***)`       | Utilise a code snippet when analyzing for tooltips or executing for outputs |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: ipynb ***)`       | Include a code snippet when making a .ipynb notebook  |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: tex ***)`       | Include a code snippet when making a .tex output   |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: html ***)`       | Include a code snippet when making HTML output   |\n",
"|   `(*** define: snippet-name ***)`       | Define a named snippet  |\n",
"|   `(*** hide ***)`       | Hide the subsequent snippet  |\n",
"|   `(*** include-output ***)`       | The output of the preceeding snippet   |\n",
"|   `(*** include-otuput: snippet-name ***)`       | The output of the snippet  |\n",
"|   `(*** include-it ***)`       | The formatted result of the preceeding snippet |\n",
"|   `(*** include-it: snippet-name ***)`       | The formatted result of the snippet  |\n",
"|   `(*** include-value: value-name ***)`       | The formatted value  |\n",

"|   `(*** raw ***)`       | The subsequent code is treated as raw text |\n",
"\n",
"The command `define` defines a named snippet (such as `final-sample`) and removes the command together with \n",
"the following F# code block from the main document. The snippet can then\n",
"be inserted elsewhere in the document using `include`. This makes it\n",
"possible to write documents without the ordering requirements of the\n",
"F# language.\n",
"\n",
"The command `hide` specifies that the following F# code block (until the next comment or command) should be \n",
"omitted from the output.\n",
"\n",
"Other commands are explained in [evaluation](evaluation.html).\n",
"\n",
"### Markdown documents\n",
"\n",
"In the Markdown mode, the entire file is a valid Markdown document, which may\n",
"contain F# code snippets (but also other code snippets). As usual, snippets are\n",
"indented with four spaces. In addition, the snippets can be annotated with special\n",
"commands. Some of them are demonstrated in the following example: \n",
"\n",
"    [lang=text]\n",
"    # First-level heading\n",
"\n",
"        [hide]\n",
"        let print s = printfn \"%s\" s\n",
"\n",
"    Some more documentation using `Markdown`.\n",
"\n",
"        [module=Hello]\n",
"        let helloWorld() = print \"Hello world!\"\n",
"\n",
"    ## Second-level heading\n",
"    With some more documentation\n",
"\n",
"        [lang=csharp]\n",
"        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello world!\");\n",
"\n",
"When processing the document, all F# snippets are copied to a separate file that\n",
"is type-checked using the F# compiler (to obtain colours and tool tips).\n",
"The commands are written on the first line of the snippet, wrapped in `[...]`:\n",
"\n",
" - The `hide` command specifies that the F# snippet should not be included in the\n",
"   final document. This can be used to include code that is needed to type-check\n",
"   the code, but is not visible to the reader.\n",
"\n",
" - The `module=Foo` command can be used to specify F# `module` where the snippet\n",
"   is placed. Use this command if you need multiple versions of the same snippet\n",
"   or if you need to separate code from different snippets.\n",
"\n",
" - The `lang=foo` command specifies the language of the snippet. If the language\n",
"   is other than `fsharp`, the snippet is copied to the output as `\u003cpre\u003e` HTML\n",
"   tag without any processing.\n",
"\n",
"Typical literate setup\n",
"----------------------\n",
"For literate programming support in your project, install the `FSharp.Formatting` nuget package.\n",
"\n",
"Now we can open `FSharp.Formatting.Literate` and use the `Literate` type to process individual\n",
"documents or entire directories.\n",
"\n",
"### Processing individual files\n",
"\n",
"Use the two static methods to turn single documents into HTML\n",
"as follows:\n"]
