"F# Formatting: Literate Scripts and Markdown\n",
"===================================\n",
"\n",
"The following example shows most of the features that can be used in a literate\n",
"F# script file with `.fsx` extension. Most of the features should be quite self-explanatory:\n",
"\n",
"    (**\n",
"    # First-level heading\n",
"    Some more documentation using `Markdown`.\n",
"    *)\n",
"    \n",
"    let helloWorld() = printfn \"Hello world!\"\n",
"\n",
"    (** \n",
"    ## Second-level heading\n",
"    With some more documentation\n",
"    *)\n",
"    \n",
"    let numbers = [ 0 .. 99 ]\n",
"    (*** include-value: numbers ***)\n",
"\n",
"    List.sum numbers\n",
"    (*** include-it ***)\n",
"\n",
"The F# script files is processed as follows:\n",
"\n",
"- A multi-line comment starting with `(**` and ending with `*)` is \n",
"  turned into text and is processed using the F# Markdown processor \n",
"  (which supports standard Markdown commands).\n",
"\n",
"- A single-line comment starting with `(***` and ending with `***)` \n",
"  is treated as a special command. The command can consist of \n",
"  `key`, `key: value` or `key=value` pairs.\n",
"\n",
"|  Literate Command     | Description               |\n",
"|:-----------------------|:----------------------------|\n",
"|   `(** ... *)`       | Markdown  |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: prepare ***)`       | Utilise a code snippet when analyzing for tooltips or executing for outputs |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: ipynb ***)`       | Include a code snippet when making a .ipynb notebook  |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: tex ***)`       | Include a code snippet when making a .tex output   |\n",
"|   `(*** condition: html ***)`       | Include a code snippet when making HTML output   |\n",
"|   `(*** hide ***)`       | Hide the subsequent snippet  |\n",
"|   `(*** include-output ***)`       | The output of the preceeding snippet   |\n",
"|   `(*** include-fsi-output ***)`       | The F# Interactive output of the preceeding snippet   |\n",
"|   `(*** include-fsi-merged-output ***)`       | The merge of console output and F# Interactive output of the preceeding snippet   |\n",

"|   `(*** raw ***)`       | The subsequent code is treated as raw text |\n",
"\n",
"### Named snippets\n",
"\n",
"The command `define` defines a named snippet (such as `final-sample`) and removes the command together with \n",
"the following F# code block from the main document. The snippet can then\n",
"be referred to using these variations. This makes it\n",
"possible to write documents without the ordering requirements of the\n",
"F# language.\n",
"\n",
"|  Literate Command     | Description               |\n",
"|:-----------------------|:----------------------------|\n",
"|   `(*** define: snippet-name ***)`       | Define a named snippet  |\n",

"|   `(*** include: snippet-name ***)`       | Include the code of the named snippet |\n",
"\n",
"#### Hiding code snippets\n",
"\n",
"The command `hide` specifies that the following F# code block (until the next comment or command) should be \n",
"omitted from the output.\n",
"\n",
"#### Evaluating and formatting results\n",
"\n",
"The commands to evaluate and format results are explained in [evaluation](evaluation.html).\n",
"You must build your documentation with evaluation turned on using `--eval`.\n",
"\n",
"### Literate Markdown Documents\n",
"\n",
"For files with `.md` extension, the entire file is a Markdown document, which may\n",
"contain F# code snippets (but also other code snippets). As usual, snippets are\n",
"indented with four spaces. In addition, the snippets can be annotated with special\n",
"commands. Some of them are demonstrated in the following example: \n",
"\n",
"    [lang=text]\n",
"    # First-level heading\n",
"\n",
"        [hide]\n",
"        let print s = printfn \"%s\" s\n",
"\n",
"    Some more documentation using `Markdown`.\n",
"\n",
"        [module=Hello]\n",
"        let helloWorld() = print \"Hello world!\"\n",
"\n",
"    ## Second-level heading\n",
"    With some more documentation\n",
"\n",
"        [lang=csharp]\n",
"        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello world!\");\n",
"\n",
"When processing the document, all F# snippets are copied to a separate file that\n",
"is type-checked using the F# compiler (to obtain colours and tool tips).\n",
"The commands are written on the first line of the named snippet, wrapped in `[...]`:\n",
"\n",
" - The `hide` command specifies that the F# snippet should not be included in the\n",
"   final document. This can be used to include code that is needed to type-check\n",
"   the code, but is not visible to the reader.\n",
"\n",
" - The `module=Foo` command can be used to specify F# `module` where the snippet\n",
"   is placed. Use this command if you need multiple versions of the same snippet\n",
"   or if you need to separate code from different snippets.\n",
"\n",
" - The `lang=foo` command specifies the language of the named snippet. If the language\n",
"   is other than `fsharp`, the snippet is copied to the output as `\u003cpre\u003e` HTML\n",
"   tag without any processing.\n",
"\n",
"### LaTeX in Literate Scripts and Markdown Documents\n",
"\n",
"Literate Scripts may contain LaTeX sections in Markdown using these forms:\n",
"\n",
"1. Single line latex starting with `$$`.\n",
"\n",
"2. A block delimited by `\\begin{equation}...\\end{equation}` or `\\begin{align}...\\end{align}`. \n",
"\n",
"3. An indented paragraph starting with `$$$`.  This is F#-literate-specific and corresponds to\n",
"   `\\begin{equation}...\\end{equation}`.\n",
"\n",
"For example\n",
"\n",
"    [lang=text]\n",
"    $$\\frac{x}{y}$$\n",
"\n",
"    \\begin{equation}\n",
"       \\frac{d}{dx} \\left. \\left( x \\left( \\left. \\frac{d}{dy} x y \\; \\right|_{y=3} \\right) \\right) \\right|_{x=2}\n",
"    \\end{equation}\n",
"\n",
"Becomes\n",
"\n",
"$$\\frac{x}{y}$$\n",
"\n",
"\\begin{equation}\n",
"   \\frac{d}{dx} \\left. \\left( x \\left( \\left. \\frac{d}{dy} x y \\; \\right|_{y=3} \\right) \\right) \\right|_{x=2}\n",
"\n",
"The LaTeX will also be used in HTML and iPython notebook outputs.\n",
"\n",
"### Making literate scripts work for different outputs\n",
"\n",
"Literate scripts and markdown can by turned into LaTex, Python Notebooks and F# scripts.\n",
"\n",
"A header may be needed to get the code to load, a typical example is this:\n",
"\n",
"    (*** condition: prepare ***)\n",
"    #nowarn \"211\"\n",
"    #I \"../src/FSharp.Formatting/bin/Release/netstandard2.0\"\n",
"    #r \"FSharp.Formatting.Common.dll\"\n",
"    #r \"FSharp.Formatting.Markdown.dll\"\n",
"    #r \"FSharp.Formatting.CodeFormat.dll\"\n",
"    #r \"FSharp.Formatting.Literate.dll\"\n",
"    (*** condition: fsx ***)\n",
"    #if FSX\n",
"    #r \"nuget: FSharp.Formatting,{{package-version}}\"\n",
"    #endif // FSX\n",
"    (*** condition: ipynb ***)\n",
"    #if IPYNB\n",
"    #r \"nuget: FSharp.Formatting,{{package-version}}\"\n",
"    #endif // IPYNB\n",
"\n",
"### Processing literate files programatically\n",

"To process file Use the two static methods to turn single documents into HTML\n",
"as follows:\n"]
