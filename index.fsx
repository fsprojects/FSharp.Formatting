# F# Formatting: Documentation Tools for F# Code

FSharp.Formatting is a set of libraries and tools for processing F# script files, markdown and for
generating API documentation. F# Formatting package is used by this project and many other repositories.

To use the tool, install and use the [fsdocs](commandline.html) tool in a typical F# project with
F# project files plus markdown and script content in the `docs` directory:

    dotnet tool install fsdocs-tool
    dotnet fsdocs build 
    dotnet fsdocs watch

To use the tool, explore the following topics:

* [Authoring Content](content.html) - explains the content expected in the `docs` directory for the `fsdocs` tool.
  

* [Using the Command line tool](commandline.html) - explains how to use the `fsdocs` tool.
  

* [Generating API documentation](apidocs.html) - how to generate HTML documentation
from "XML comments" in your .NET libraries. The tool handles comments written in
Markdown too.
  

* [Styling](styling.html) - explains some options for styling the output of `fsdocs`.
  

* [Using literate programming](literate.html) - explains how to generate documentation
for your projects or to write nicely formatted F# blog posts.
  

* [Embedding F# outputs in literate programming](evaluation.html) - provides more details on literate programming and
explains how to embed results of a literate script file in the generated output. This way,
you can easily format the results of running your code!
  

## Using FSharp.Formatting as a library

F# Formatting is also [available on NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Formatting) as a set of libraries.

* [Markdown parser](markdown.html) - explains the F# Markdown
processor that is available in this library with some basic examples of
document processing.
  

* [F# code formatting](codeformat.html) - more details about the F# code
formatter and how to use it to obtain information about F# source files.
