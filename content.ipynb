    "# Creating Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The [\"fsdocs\" tool](commandline.html) allows documentation for a site to be built\n",
    "from content in a `docs` directory. The expected structure for a `docs` directory is\n",
    "\n",
    "    [lang=text]\n",
    "    docs/**/*.md                  -- markdown with embedded code, converted to html and optionally tex/ipynb\n",
    "    docs/**/*.fsx                 -- fsx scripts converted to html and optionally tex/ipynb\n",
    "    docs/**/*                     -- other content, copied over\n",
    "    docs/**/_template.html        -- optional template, specifies the HTML template for this directory and its contents\n",
    "    docs/**/_template.tex         -- optionally indicates Latex files should be generated\n",
    "    docs/**/_template.ipynb       -- optionally indicates F# ipynb files should be generated\n",
    "    docs/**/_template.fsx         -- optionally indicates F# fsx files should be generated (even from markdown)\n",
    "    docs/reference/_template.html -- optionally specifies the default template for reference docs\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing is by these two commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    dotnet fsdocs build\n",
    "    dotnet fsdocs watch\n",
    "\n",
    "The output goes in `output/` by default.  Processing is recursive, making this a form of static site generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Literate Scripts and Markdown Content\n",
    "\n",
    "The input directory may contain [literate scripts](literate.html) and markdown content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Content that is not `*.fsx` or `*.md` is copied across.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default Styling Content\n",
    "\n",
    "By default additional content such as `fsdocs-search.js`, `fsdocs-tips.js` and `fsdocs-default.css` are included in\n",
    "the `content` directory of the output.  This can be suppressed with `--nodefaultcontent` or by having your own\n",
    "copy of this content in your `content` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ignored Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Any file or directory beginning with `.` is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Front matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Each content file can have an optional frontmatter.  This determines the navigation bar title, categorization ordering and meta tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "For markdown, the format is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "title: Some Title\n",
    "category: Some Category\n",
    "categoryindex: 2\n",
    "index: 3\n",
    "description: Some description\n",
    "keywords: tag1, tag2, tag3\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "For F# scripts the frontmatter is in this form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (**\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    title: A Literate Script\n",
    "    category: Examples\n",
    "    categoryindex: 2\n",
    "    index: 1\n",
    "    description: Some description\n",
    "    keywords: tag1, tag2, tag3\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "    *)\n",
    "\n",
    "All entries are optional.\n",
    "The `categoryindex` determines the ordering of categories.\n",
    "The `index` determines the ordering of within each category.\n",
    "The `title` is used in the navigation bar instead of any title inferred from the document.\n",
    "The `description` is used in `\u003cmeta name=\"description\"` as part of the `{{fsdocs-meta-tags}}` substitution.\n",
    "The `keywords` are also used in a meta tag as part of `{{fsdocs-meta-tags}}`. Separate them using a `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Link Translation for Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "If an input is used in markdown as a target of a markdown direct link, then that is replaced by the output file. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Some Text](some-file.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Some Text](some-file.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "if `some-file.md` is one of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-language Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Versions of content in other languages should go in two-letter coded sub-directories, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    docs/ja/...\n",
    "    docs/de/...\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be elided from the main table-of-contents and search indexes.  (Currently no language-specific\n",
    "table of contents is built, nor language-specific site search indexes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Templates and Substitutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Templates are used for HTML (`_template.html`), LaTeX (`_template.tex`), Notebooks (`_template.ipynb)`\n",
    "and F# script outputs (`_template.fsx`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following substitutions determine the primary (non-styling) content of your site.\n",
    "For example `{{fsdocs-content}}` is replaced with the generated content in each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitutions are applied when generating content from HTML templates, IPYNB templates, FSX templates.\n",
    "They are also applied to content apart from Markdown inline code ``...``, Markdown LaTeX and\n",
    "generated outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Styling](styling.html) for information about template parameters and styling beyond the default template.\n",
    "\n",

    "`root` | `\u003cPackageProjectUrl\u003e` else `/` followed by `fsdocs-collection-name`\n",

    "markdown code snippets of the special form ``cref:T:MyNamespace.MyType`` where `T:MyNamespace.MyType`\n",
