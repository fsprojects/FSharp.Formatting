"F# Formatting: Documentation tools\n",
"==================================\n",
"\n",
"The FSharp.Formatting package includes libraries and tools for processing F# script files, markdown and components\n",
"for documentation generation.\n",
"\n",
"Functionality from the F# Formatting package is used by the [MiniScaffold template](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/MiniScaffold/) \n",
"that is used by a large number of open source .NET projects, as well as Waypoint and many other repositories.\n",
"\n",
"F# Formatting can be used as a .NET tool called [`fsdocs`](commandline.html):\n",
"\n",
"    dotnet tool install FSharp.Formatting.CommandTool\n",
"    dotnet fsdocs build --input docs \n",
"\n",
"The F# Formatting package is also [available on NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Formatting) as a set of libraries. The NuGet package comes with a load script `FSharp.Formatting.fsx` that references all the required DLLs\n",
"and paths. \n",
"\n",
"The sub-components are:\n",
"\n",
" - [Command line tool](commandline.html) - documents how to use the `fsdocs` tool.\n",
"   \n",
" - [Literate programming](literate.html) - if you want to use the library to generate documentation\n",
"   for your projects or if you want to use it to write nicely formatted F# blog posts, then\n",
"   start here. This page describes the literate programming sample. \n",
"   \n",
" - [Literate output embedding](evaluation.html) provides more details on literate programming and\n",
"   explains how to embed results of a literate script file in the generated output. This way,\n",
"   you can easily format the results of running your code!\n",
"\n",
" - [Markdown parser](markdown.html) - this page provides more details about the F# Markdown\n",
"   processor that is available in this library. It includes some basic examples of\n",
"   document processing.\n",
"\n",
" - [F# code formatting](codeformat.html) - this page provides more details about the F# code\n",
"   formatter; it discusses how to call it to obtain information about F# source files.\n",
"\n",
" - [API documentation tool](apidocs.html) - provides a brief documentation for a tool\n",
"   that generates nice HTML documentation from \"XML comments\" in your .NET libraries.\n",
"   The tool handles comments written in Markdown too and generates a search index.\n",
"\n",
" - [Contribute](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Formatting/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) - how do I contribute?\n",
"\n",
"The documentation for this library is generated automatically using the literate programming \n",
"tools that are built on top of it and are described in the [literate programming page](literate.html).\n",
"If you spot a typo, please submit a pull request! The source Markdown and F# script files are\n",
"available in the [docs folder on GitHub](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Formatting/tree/master/docs).\n",
