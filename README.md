Once built, you can run the command-line tool to self-build the docs for this directory using 

    dotnet build
    src\fsdocs-tool\bin\Debug\net8.0\fsdocs.exe watch
    src\fsdocs-tool\bin\Debug\net8.0\fsdocs.exe build --clean

### Pipelines

Run

    dotnet fsi build.fsx -- --help

to see what other pipelines can be run from `build.fsx`.

    dotnet fsi build.fsx -- -p Verify

Will perform the linting, unit tests and analyzer check.
This is useful to run locally before submitting your PR.
