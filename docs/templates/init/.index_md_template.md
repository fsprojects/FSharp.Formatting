# Welcome to your documentation with fsdocs!

For full guides please visit [the FSharp.Formatting](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/) documentation pages.

As a quickstart you can start with changing this file with **any** _markdown_ `content` you like.

Assuming you have initialized fsdocs with default settings, you can start the preview server with:

```
fsdocs watch
```

This will start a local server on port 8091, meaning you should be able to see content of this file rendered on [http://localhost:8901/](http://localhost:8901/)

while you can write code blocks in markdown like this:

```fsharp
let a = 42
```

fsdocs supports a more powerful variant of fsharp scripts called [literate scripts](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/literate.html).

in literate scripts, you can write markdown and fsharp code in the same file, and fsdocs will render the markdown and execute the fsharp code. 
Check the `literate_sample.fsx` file in this folder for an example.
