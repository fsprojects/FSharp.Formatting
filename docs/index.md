F# Formatting: Documentation tools
==================================

The F# Formatting libraries (`FSharp.CodeFormat.dll` and `FSharp.Markdown.dll`) include 
an F# implementation of the Markdown parser and a F# code formatter that can be used to tokenize F# 
code and obtain information about tokens including tool-tips (as in Visual Studio and MonoDevelop) 
with type information. The package also comes with a sample that implements literate programming for F#
(and was used to generate this documentation).

<div class="row">
  <div class="span1"></div>
  <div class="span6">
    <div class="well well-small" id="nuget">
      The F# Formatting Library is available as <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Data">FSharp.Formatting on NuGet</a>.
      To install it, run the following command in the <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console">Package Manager Console</a>:
      <pre>PM> Install-Package FSharp.Formatting</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="span1"></div>
</div>

Alternatively, you can download the [source as a ZIP file](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting/zipball/master)
or browse the [GitHub](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting) repository.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for this library is generated automatically (using the literate programming 
tools that are built on top of it and are described in [literate programming page](demo.html).
If you spot a typo, please submit a pull request! The source Markdown and F# script files are
available in the [docs folder on GitHub](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting/tree/master/docs).
I hope it is also a good sample showing how to write documentation for F# projects.

 - [Literate programming](demo.html) - if you want to use the library to generate documentation
   for your projects or if you want to use it to write nicely formatted F# blog posts, then
   start here! This page describes the literate programming sample.

 - [Markdown parser](markdown.html) - this page provides more details about the F# Markdown
   processor that is available in this library. It includes some basic examples of
   document processing.

 - [F# code formatting](codeformat.html) - this page provides more details about the F# code
   formatter; it discusses how to call it to obtain information about F# source files.
