F# Formatting: Documentation tools
==================================

The F# Formatting libraries (`FSharp.CodeFormat.dll`, `FSharp.Markdown.dll` and `FSharp.Literate.dll`) include 
an F# implementation of a Markdown parser and an F# code formatter that can be used to tokenize F# 
code and obtain information about tokens including tool-tips (as in Visual Studio and MonoDevelop) 
with type information. The package also comes with a sample that implements literate programming for F#
(and was used to generate this documentation).

 - The F# Formatting package is used by the [ProjectScaffold template](http://fsprojects.github.io/ProjectScaffold/) 
   that is used by a large number of open source .NET projects. If you're interested in using F# Formatting
   for generating documentation for your project, then starting with ProjectScaffold is the best option.

 - The F# Formatting package is [available on NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Formatting">FSharp.Formatting),
   so if you want to use some of its components (for blogging, Markdown parsing, or F# code formatting),
   then the best option is to get the package.

 - The NuGet package comes with a load script `FSharp.Formatting.fsx` that references all the required DLLs
   and paths. If you are calling F# Formatting from a script file, then it is recommended to use `#load "FSharp.Formatting.fsx"`
   as a future-proof way of referencing the library.

You can download the [source as a ZIP file](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Formatting/zipball/master)
or download the [compiled binaries](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Formatting/archive/release.zip) as a ZIP.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for this library is generated automatically using the literate programming 
tools that are built on top of it and are described in the [literate programming page](literate.html).
If you spot a typo, please submit a pull request! The source Markdown and F# script files are
available in the [docs folder on GitHub](https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Formatting/tree/master/docs).
I hope it is also a good sample showing how to write documentation for F# projects.

 - [Literate programming](literate.html) - if you want to use the library to generate documentation
   for your projects or if you want to use it to write nicely formatted F# blog posts, then
   start here! This page describes the literate programming sample. 
   
 - [Output embedding](evaluation.html) provides more details on literate programming and
   explains how to embed results of a literate script file in the generated output. This way,
   you can easily format the results of running your code!

 - [Markdown parser](markdown.html) - this page provides more details about the F# Markdown
   processor that is available in this library. It includes some basic examples of
   document processing.

 - [F# code formatting](codeformat.html) - this page provides more details about the F# code
   formatter; it discusses how to call it to obtain information about F# source files.

 - [Library documentation tool](metadata.html) - provides a brief documentation for a tool
   that generates nice HTML documentation from "XML comments" in your (not just) F# libraries.
   The tool is a replacement of `FsHtmlDoc` - it uses Razor for easy templating and handles
   comments written in Markdown too.
